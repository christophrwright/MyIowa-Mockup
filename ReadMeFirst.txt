How to run our Code:

Our code only works in Firefox, so it should be opened in that browser. We've included a copy of jquery to make sure that it runs properly, and hopefully avoid the problem we ran into in testing.
Open the folder (which you've done), and click on Home. It should open in your browser window. From there, the site is fully navigable. The menubar is a little off, at least on Chris's computer - it flashes on and off unless you get the mouse in the right place. We arent sure if your computer will have the same problem, but hopefully not. If you click on a bad link, you will be directed to the Missing Page Page, which has links to all the working pages in the site. 

That's it! We hope you like it.
